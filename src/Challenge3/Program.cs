     * Write a C# program that takes in a list of integers and returns the longest increasing subsequence in that list.
     * A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
     * An increasing subsequence is a subsequence in which the elements are in increasing order.

     * Requirements:
     *
     *  - The program should find the longest increasing subsequence in the list.
